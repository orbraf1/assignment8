# Assignment 8

### Hey, my name is Or Braf. Those are the main things I did in this assignment:
- I converted my personal website to a Flask project format. I also created two routes in app.py for this page: '/' and '/cv'.
- I created a new route called '/assignment8' and demonstrated all the six requirements while creating two more templates: title.html for the "include" task & base.html for the "block" and "super" tasks.
